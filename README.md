# Air-quality-monitoring-and-predictive-analysis-system
o develop an Arduino-based air quality monitoring system that collects real-time data (e.g., CO2, smoke, temperature, humidity) and sends it to a computer/cloud for data analysis, visualization, and prediction of hazardous air quality events using data science techniques.
